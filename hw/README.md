# Install PlatformIO Core to build and upload

Install the files needed for the esp8266 version 12 board:

    platformio init --board esp12e

Place the source files into the `src/` folder (at least a `main.cpp` has to be there).

Build with:

    platformio run


PlatformIO can be easily integrated with [Sublime Text](http://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/ide/sublimetext.html).
That's all! :whale:
